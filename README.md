# ECG-Arrhythmia-Detection
A project focused on enhancing arrhythmia detection and classification using deep learning techniques applied to ECG signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.

Integrating CNN-BiLSTM Architecture for Precise Arrhythmia Detection in Cardiovascular Health
In response to the pressing global health concern of cardiovascular diseases, particularly arrhythmias, the project addresses the challenges of automated detection and classification. The variability in morphological and temporal features across patients necessitates a robust approach. To this end, the methodology encompasses meticulous data processing and modeling. The proposed model combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architectures. The CNN-BiLSTM model is tailored to effectively process and extract hierarchical features from Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, capturing both local patterns and long-range dependencies. This hybrid architecture is pivotal in enhancing the accuracy of arrhythmia detection, contributing to the advancement of cardiovascular health.
